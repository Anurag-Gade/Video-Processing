# Video-Processing

This repository contains code for video processing techniques such as video analysis, contrast enhancement, edge detection and smoothing. 

Notebook 1 - Code for nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic-based interpolation methods to increase the number of pixels in each frame of a given video.

Notebook 2 - Code for applying power law transformation, piecewise linear transformation, gray-level slicing, bit-plane slicing, and histogram equalization on a video.

Notebook 3 - Code for applying smoothing, using a smoothing and a gaussian filter on a video. 

Notebook 4 - Code for performing video sharpening on the video using Sobel and Laplacian masks.

Notebook 5 - Code for performing frame-wise 2-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D-DFT) on a given video.

This was done as a part of the Assignment 1 of the course EEE 435, Digital Image Processing at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus.
